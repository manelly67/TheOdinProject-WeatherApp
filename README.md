Javascript Data Fetching
------------------------

This JavaScript project fetchs data from a third-party API.<br>
The url view is: https://manelly67.github.io/TheOdinProject-WeatherApp

Functionality
-------------

### JavaScript DOM Access ###
The project generates all the DOM elements through JavaScript code. This approach allows for more dynamic and interactive web pages, as the DOM can be modified in response to user actions or other events.

### Css styles ###
Responsive design for screens of different sizes.
The background is interactively modified based on temperature and other data obtained in the search, through functions within the code.

### Constraint Validation DOM Properties ###
Was used the validity property to check the boolean property related to the validity of the input element. In order to check validity.valueMissing and validity.patternMismatch.
<br>
Inside the html input element was defined the pattern using Regexps and the required attribute.

### Display and Remove Error Messages ###
Are shown error messages to the user using the DOM and remove them once the input is corrected.<br>

### No environment is used ###
For this specific project, the use of .env file to store the url address is not contemplated, although it is the correct way to do it.
